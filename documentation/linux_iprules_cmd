LINUX DOCUMENTATION

Block a Single IP:

sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address=23.21.86.108
reject'
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Unblock a single IP:

sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="23.21.86.108" reject'
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Reset to Default:

sudo rm -rf /etc/firewalld/zones

Block Multiple IPs

sudo ipset create blacklist hash:ip
ipset add blacklist 23.21.86.108
sudo iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set blacklist src -j DROP

Verify IPtables

sudo iptables -L INPUT -v -n --line-numbers

Delete IP list rule

sudo iptables -D INPUT line number

Display IP list

Ipset list

Given txt file

sudo touch ips.txt
sudo chown albert:albert ips.txt
sudo echo "23.21.86.108" >> ips.txt
sudo bash -c 'while read ip; do sudo ipset add blacklist $ip; done' < /home/albert/ips.txt


REJECT vs DROP:

REJECT: Discard packet and send error response back to sender
DROP: Silently discard packet with no error response sent

We should be choosing DROP for this case, as we do not want the sender to know that we have already dealt with the issue

Public IP address of Linux Remote Server:

curl ifconfig.me

IPtables block single IP:

sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 23.21.86.108 -j DROP

We should be using IPtables, as a common-connected command system to use for both single and multiple IP blocking will be more organized than using FirewallD along with IPtables.

Reset IPtable to default:

sudo iptables -F
